Great! Based on the plan I provided earlier, here is a daily plan for someone with approximately 20 hours of free time per week:

**Monday:**

* Morning run: 30 minutes at moderate pace (e.g., 5 km)
* Strength training: 30-45 minutes (focusing on core, legs, and glutes)
* Evening stretching/foam rolling: 15-20 minutes

**Tuesday:**

* Morning run: 30-40 minutes at moderate pace (e.g., 6 km)
* Interval training: 20-30 minutes (e.g., 4 x 1 km at race pace, with 2-3 minutes rest in between)
* Evening stretching/foam rolling: 15-20 minutes

**Wednesday:**

* Rest day or cross-training activity (e.g., cycling, swimming)

**Thursday:**

* Morning run: 30-40 minutes at moderate pace (e.g., 7 km)
* Hill repeats: 20-30 minutes (e.g., 3 x 1 km uphill with 2-3 minutes rest in between)
* Evening stretching/foam rolling: 15-20 minutes

**Friday:**

* Morning run: 30-40 minutes at moderate pace (e.g., 8 km)
* Long slow run: 45-60 minutes (e.g., 10 km)
* Evening stretching/foam rolling: 15-20 minutes

**Saturday:**

**Sunday:**

* Evening stretching/foam rolling: 15-20 minutes

In addition to the above workout schedule, here are some additional tips for achieving your marathon goal:

* Make sure to gradually increase your running distance and intensity over time. Don't try to do too much too soon, as this can lead to injury.
* Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine at least 2-3 times per week. This will help improve your overall endurance and reduce the risk of injury.
* Make sure to stretch and foam roll after each workout to help with muscle recovery and flexibility.
* Listen to your body and take rest days as needed. It's important to allow your body time to recover and rebuild after each workout.
* Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, especially during and after workouts.
* Focus on proper nutrition and sleep to help fuel your body for training and recovery.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications to the plan based on your specific needs and goals.

**Monday:**

time.
* Strength training: 30-45 minutes (focusing on core, legs, and glutes)
        + Consideration: Choose exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once to maximize your strength training time. For example, you can do squats, lunges, and deadlifts for your l

legs and glutes, and planks or bridges for your core.
