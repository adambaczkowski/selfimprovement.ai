As an amateur runner, I understand that training for a marathon requires consistent effort and dedication. With only 10 hours per week to devote to training, my plan will focus on
gradual progression and injury prevention. Here's my one-year plan starting from today (23rd April 2024):

April 2024:
Full name: April Training Month
Date: 23-04-2024 to 30-04-2024
Task List:

1. Assess current fitness level through a series of short runs (3-5 km) at a moderate pace. Take note of heart rate and perceived exertion.
2. Gradually increase running distance by 10-15% each week, up to a maximum of 6 km.
3. Incorporate strength training exercises 2-3 times a week, focusing on core, glutes, and legs (for running efficiency).
4. Practice stretching and foam rolling for flexibility and injury prevention.
5. Gradually increase running pace by 10-15% each week, while maintaining the same distance.
6. Incorporate interval training once a week, alternating between high-intensity runs (e.g., sprints) and recovery runs (e.g., slow jogs).
7. Monitor progress by tracking running times, heart rates, and perceived exertion levels. Adjust the plan as needed based on results.

May 2024:
Full name: Building Endurance Month
Date: 01-05-2024 to 31-05-2024
Task List:

1. Continue increasing running distance by 10-15% each week, up to a maximum of 8 km.
2. Incorporate longer runs (10-12 km) once a week, at a moderate pace.
3. Gradually increase running pace by 10-15% each week, while maintaining the same distance.
4. Introduce hill repeats once a week, to improve running efficiency and power.
5. Practice fueling strategies during runs (e.g., gels, sports drinks) to ensure proper hydration and energy supply during the marathon.
6. Gradually reduce the intensity of interval training, focusing on sustained endurance.
7. Monitor progress by tracking running times, heart rates, and perceived exertion levels. Adjust the plan as needed based on results.

June 2024:
Full name: Taper Before The Marathon Month
Date: 01-06-2024 to 30-06-2024
Task List:

1. Reduce running volume by 20-30% each week, focusing on quality over quantity.
2. Incorporate active recovery days (e.g., yoga, stretching) to maintain flexibility and prevent overtraining.
3. Gradually reduce the intensity of runs, aiming for a slow jog or walk to preserve energy reserves.
4. Focus on mental preparation through visualization techniques, goal setting, and positive self-talk.
5. Review marathon strategy (e.g., pace, fueling) and develop a contingency plan in case of unexpected events.
6. Gradually reduce the intensity of strength training exercises, focusing on maintenance rather than improvement.
7. Monitor progress by tracking running times, heart rates, and perceived exertion levels. Adjust the plan as needed based on results.

July 2024:
Full name: Rest and Recovery Before The Marathon Month
Date: 01-07-2024 to 31-07-2024
Task List:

1. Take a complete rest day from running, focusing on active recovery (e.g., yoga, stretching) or light walking.
2. Gradually increase strength training exercises, focusing on maintenance rather than improvement.
3. Practice mental preparation techniques (e.g., visualization, goal setting) to maintain motivation and focus.
4. Review marathon strategy and contingency plans, and make any necessary adjustments.
5. Monitor progress by tracking running times, heart rates, and perceived exertion levels. Adjust the plan as needed based on results.

August 2024:
Full name: Final Marathon Preparation Month
Date: 01-08-2024 to 31-08-2024
Task List:

1. Review and finalize marathon strategy, including pace, fueling, and contingency plans.
2. Gradually increase running volume and intensity in the last two weeks before the marathon, focusing on quality over quantity.
3. Incorporate race-specific training (e.g., practicing the course, navigating aid stations) to prepare for the actual event.
4. Practice mental preparation techniques (e.g., visualization, positive self-talk) to maintain focus and motivation during the marathon.
5. Monitor progress by tracking running times, heart rates, and perceived exertion levels. Adjust the plan as needed based on results.
6. On race day, focus on pacing, hydration, and mental toughness to cross the finish line successfully.

Remember, consistency and gradual progression are key to avoiding injuries and reaching your marathon goal. Stay committed, stay focused, and good luck!

Congratulations on your decision to run a marathon! As an amateur runner, it's important to have a well-structured training plan that takes into account your body parameters and
available practice time. Here's a year-long plan for you to achieve your goal of running a marathon by April 23rd, 2025:

**Month 1: April 23rd - May 23rd**

* Set a realistic goal of running 3 times a week with at least one long run on the weekends (Sunday).
* Start with shorter distances like 3-4 km and gradually increase the distance by 0.5-1 km each week.
* Incorporate strength training exercises 2-3 times a week to build endurance and prevent injuries. Focus on core, legs, and glutes.

**Month 2: May 24th - June 22nd**

* Continue running at least 3 times a week with longer distances (5-6 km) and higher intensity during the weekdays.
* Incorporate interval training once a week to improve speed and endurance.
* Gradually increase the weekend run distance to 10-12 km.

**Month 3: June 23rd - July 22nd**

* Maintain the same running routine as the previous month, with an added focus on flexibility and stretching exercises.
* Incorporate hill repeats once a week to improve running efficiency and endurance.
* Gradually increase the weekend run distance to 15-16 km.

**Month 4: July 23rd - August 20th**

* Reduce the frequency of runs during the first two weeks due to increased heat and humidity.
* Incorporate longer runs (18-20 km) on the weekends to build endurance.
* Start incorporating nutrition planning and hydration strategies for long runs.

**Month 5: August 21st - September 17th**
