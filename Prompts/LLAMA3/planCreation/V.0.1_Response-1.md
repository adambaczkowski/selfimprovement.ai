**April - Month 1 (23-30 April 20****)

Since I have approximately 20 hours of free time per week, I'll distribute my running schedule across 5 days, with a mix of morning and
evening runs to accommodate my busy schedule.

Here's the breakdown for each day:

* **Monday**: Morning run (3 km) + strength training
        + Wake up at 6:30 AM and go for a 3 km easy run.
        + After the run, perform leg press exercises for 20-30 minutes to target quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.
* **Tuesday**: Evening run (5 km)
        + Start with a 2 km warm-up run at an easy pace.
        + Increase the intensity by running 1.5 km at a moderate pace.
        + Finish with a 1.5 km cool-down run at an easy pace.
* **Wednesday**: Morning run (3 km) + stretching
        + Wake up at 6:30 AM and go for a 3 km easy run.
        + After the run, perform static stretches for 10-15 minutes to target quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and IT band.
* **Thursday**: Rest day or active recovery (foam rolling)
        + Take a rest day from running or opt for an active recovery session using foam rolling techniques to release tension in your legs and g
glutes.
* **Friday**: Evening run (5 km)
        + Start with a 2 km warm-up run at an easy pace.
        + Increase the intensity by running 1.5 km at a moderate pace.
        + Finish with a 1.5 km cool-down run at an easy pace.
* **Saturday**: Morning run (5 km) + strength training
        + Wake up at 7:30 AM and go for a 5 km moderate-paced run.
        + After the run, perform leg press exercises for 20-30 minutes to target quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.
* **Sunday**: Long run (8 km)
        + Start with a 2 km warm-up run at an easy pace.
        + Increase the intensity by running 4 km at a moderate pace.
        + Finish with a 2 km cool-down run at an easy pace.

Remember to stay hydrated and fuel your body properly before, during, and after each run. Listen to your body and adjust the plan as needed to avoid injury or burnout.
