To help an amateur person plan their marathon in a year, I've created a detailed plan broken down by month with specific tasks for each
month leading up to April 23, 2024 (the start date). The overall goal is to progressively increase the weekly training time and maintain
consistency throughout the preparation period.

January:
* Week 1-2: Begin with short runs (3-5 miles) 2 times a week, focusing on proper breathing and pacing techniques. Set a monthly goal of
completing 5 miles by the end of January. (01-31)

February:
* Week 3-4: Increase run length to 8 miles, maintaining 2 times a week. Aim for 20 miles total by the end of February (02-29)

March:
* Week 5-6: Maintain weekly runs at 8 miles and increase strength training exercises such as lunges, squats, and leg presses 1-2 times per
week. Set a monthly goal to run 10 miles by the end of March (03-31)

April:
* Week 7-8: Begin incorporating tempo runs into your weekly training plan, focusing on maintaining proper form and increasing lactate
threshold. Run 2-3 times during this month, aiming for 20 miles total (04-30)

May:
* Week 9-10: Maintain regular distance runs while incorporating hill repeats or fartlek sessions to improve running endurance. Set a
monthly goal of completing 22 miles by the end of May (05-31)

June:
* Week 11-12: Incorporate long runs into your weekly training plan, aiming for 25-30 miles during this month (06-30)

July:
* Week 13-14: Focus on maintaining distance runs while incorporating speed workouts such as interval training and 800 meters repeats. Set
a monthly goal of running 28 miles by the end of July (07-31)

August:
* Week 15-16: Increase strength training exercises, focusing on core stability and upper body muscle development. Aim for 30 miles total
during this month (08-31)

September:
* Week 17-18: Maintain distance runs while incorporating trail runs or hill repeats to improve overall endurance and prevent injury. Set a
monthly goal of running 35 miles by the end of September (09-30)

October:
* Week 19-20: Introduce more tempos runs during your weekly training plan, focusing on improving lactate threshold. Run 2-3 times during
this month, aiming for 40 miles total (10-31)

November:
* Week 21-22: Increase the distance of tempo runs to 4 miles and incorporate speed workouts such as speed intervals or 1500 meters
repeats. Set a monthly goal of running 45 miles by the end of November (11-30)

December:
* Week 23-24: Maintain regular distance runs while incorporating shorter, high-intensity interval training sessions to improve overall
running efficiency. Aim for 50 miles during this month (12-31)

By following this plan, you will steadily build your weekly mileage and strength throughout the year, ultimately preparing you for a
successful marathon run on April 23, 2024. Remember to listen to your body, stay consistent with your training schedule, and make
adjustments as needed to achieve your goals while avoiding injury.

As an amateur runner aiming to complete a marathon in one year, I will break down the year into months and create specific goals for each
month while taking into consideration the provided body parameters (sex=Male, height=180cm, age=27, weight=75kg). Here is a detailed plan
for the next 12 months:

1. January 2024 - March 2024
* Month 1: Build a solid foundation by increasing weekly mileage gradually. Goal: Increase weekly mileage by 15% (e.g., 5 to 7 miles per
day) and maintain consistent strength training exercises. Start with easy runs on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at a comfortable pace;
Tuesday and Thursday will be longer runs with intervals or tempo runs, and Saturday will be for long runs of approximately 60-70 miles.
* January 2024 (23-rd): Strengthen core muscles by practicing planks, crunches, and Russian twists to improve posture and stability.
1. April 2024 - June 2024
* Month 2: Improve stamina and mental strength with regular long runs on weekends. Goal: Complete 60 miles during the two months in
training (e.g., 14-15 weekend long runs). Include running meditation sessions to enhance focus and mental clarity during long runs.
* April 23, 2024: Strengthen leg muscles by performing lower body workouts such as lunges, squats, calf raises, and jumping jacks. Aim for
2 sets of 12-15 reps per exercise with a 1-minute rest between sets.
1. July 2024 - September 2024
* Month 3: Increase the volume of long runs while incorporating more speed sessions. Goal: Complete 75 miles during these two months
(e.g., 16-17 weekend long runs). Include hill training and tempo runs to improve endurance and running efficiency.
* July 23, 2024: Strengthen upper body muscles by performing exercises such as push-ups, rows, chest press, and shoulder rotations. Aim
for 3 sets of 10-12 reps per exercise with a 1-minute rest between sets.
1. October 2024 - November 2024
* Month 4: Incorporate cross-training activities to build overall fitness. Goal: Complete 80 miles during these two months (e.g., 18-19
weekend long runs). Try cycling, swimming, or yoga classes to improve cardiovascular endurance and flexibility.
* October 23, 2024: Strengthen hips and glutes by performing exercises such as deadlifts, hip thrusts, glute bridges, and side lunges. Aim
for 3 sets of 12-15 reps per exercise with a 1-minute rest between sets.
1. December 2024 - February 2025
* Month 5: Focus on race preparation with shorter long runs leading up to the marathon event. Goal: Complete 45 miles during these two
months (e.g., 19-20 weekend long runs). Incorporate mental visualization and relaxation techniques for a calm mindset before race day.
* December 23, 2024: Strengthen leg muscles by performing leg press exercises or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with
running-specific drills such as hill sprints or lateral shuffles. Aim for 2 sets of 12-15 reps per exercise with a 1-minute rest between
sets.
1. March 2025 - April 2025
* Month 6: Increase the volume and intensity of long runs while maintaining proper nutrition and hydration during training. Goal: Complete
90 miles during these two months (e.g., 21-22 weekend long runs). Implement progressive running drills to improve running technique and
race performance.
* March 23, 2025: Strengthen core muscles by practicing planks, side plank, and Russian twists with additional arm movements for a
balanced workout. Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 reps per exercise with a 1-minute rest between sets.
1. May 2025 - June 2025
* Month 7: Focus on race day preparation and tapering the training volume leading up to the marathon event. Goal: Complete 60 miles during
these two months (e.g., 22-23 weekend long runs). Attend a final marathon preparation seminar or workshop for tips, advice, and motivation
before race day.
* May 23, 2025: Strengthen leg muscles by performing single-leg Romanian deadlifts or glute bridges with clamshells. Aim for 2 sets of
12-15 reps per exercise with a 1-minute rest between sets.
1. July 2025 - September 2025
* Month 8: Finalize marathon preparation and build endurance in the lead up to race day. Goal: Complete 75 miles during these two months
(e.g., 24-26 weekend long runs). Include final race simulation sessions with hills, wind, and temperature adjustments.
* July 23, 2025: Strengthen core muscles by practicing planks or V-sit hold exercises with additional twists for a well-rounded workout.
Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 reps per exercise with a 1-minute rest between sets.
1. October 2025 - November 2025
* Month 9: Complete the marathon and celebrate your accomplishment! Goal: Run the marathon on the planned race date (October 30, 2025).
Implement post-race recovery strategies such as foam rolling, stretching, and electrolyte replacement to aid in muscle recovery and
replenishment.
* October 23, 2025: Reflect on the entire training journey by writing down your experiences, setting new goals for future marathons, or
starting a running club with fellow marathon finishers to continue developing your passion for running.
